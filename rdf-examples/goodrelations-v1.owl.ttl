For the latter, gr:hasMPN is a better choice.\n\nImportant: Be careful when assuming two products or services instances or offering instances to be identical based on the SKU. Since SKUs are unique only for the same gr:BusinessEntity, this can be assumed only when you are sure that the two SKU values refer to the same business entity. Such can be done by taking into account the provenance of the data. As long as instances of gr:Offering are concerned, you can also check that the offerings are being offered by the same gr:Business Entity.\n\nUsually, the properties gr:hasEAN_UCC-13 and gr:hasGTIN-14 are much more reliable identifiers, because they are globally unique.\n\nSee also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_Keeping_Unit."@en ;

The unit of measurement for the eligible quantity is specified using the gr:hasUnitOfMeasurement datatype property, which points to an UN/CEFACT Common Code (3 characters).\n\t\nIn most cases, the appropriate unit of measurement is the UN/CEFACT Common Code \"C62\" for \"Unit or piece\", since a gr:Offering is defined by the quantity and unit of measurement of all items included (e.g. \"1 kg of bananas plus a 2 kg of apples\"). As long at the offering consists of only one item, it is also possible to use an unit of measurement of choice for specifying the price per unit. For bundles, however, only  \"C62\" for \"Unit or piece\" is a valid unit of measurement.\n\nYou can assume that the price is given per unit or piece if there is no gr:hasUnitOfMeasurement property attached to the price.\n\t\nWhether VAT and sales taxes are included in this price is specified using the property gr:valueAddedTaxIncluded (xsd:boolean).\n\t\nThe price per unit of measurement is specified as a float value of the gr:hasCurrencyValue property. The currency is specified via the gr:hasCurrency datatype property.

Such can be done easily by importing and refining the GoodRelations ontology.\n\nNote 2: For Google, attaching a gr:validThrough statement to a gr:UnitPriceSpecification is mandatory. \n"@en ;
